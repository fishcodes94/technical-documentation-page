          Java is a widely-used, object-oriented programming language known for
          its portability, robustness, and ease of use. Developed by Sun
          Microsystems in 1995 and now maintained by Oracle Corporation, Java
          allows developers to write code that can run on any device equipped
          with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This "write once, run anywhere"
          capability makes it ideal for cross-platform applications, ranging
          from mobile apps to large-scale enterprise systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Java emphasizes simplicity and readability, making it accessible for
          beginners while providing powerful features for advanced users. Its
          extensive standard library, strong memory management, and built-in
          security features contribute to its popularity in various domains,
          including web development, scientific computing, and Android app
          development.

        <header>What You Should Already Know</header>
        <p>
          Before diving into Java, you should have a basic understanding of
          programming concepts such as variables, control structures (like loops
          and conditionals), and functions. Familiarity with another programming
          language, particularly an object-oriented language like C++ or Python,
          will help you grasp Java's syntax and concepts more quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Knowledge of basic computer science principles, such as algorithms and
          data structures, will also be beneficial. While Java is designed to be
          user-friendly, having a solid foundation in these areas will enable
          you to make the most of Java's features and libraries.
        </p>

      <section id="javaScript-and-java" class="main-section">
        <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
        <p>
          Despite their similar names, Java and JavaScript are distinct
          languages with different uses and design philosophies. Java is a
          statically-typed, object-oriented language primarily used for building
          server-side applications, mobile apps, and large systems. JavaScript,
          on the other hand, is a dynamically-typed scripting language used
          mainly for client-side web development to create interactive web
          pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          The confusion often arises because JavaScript was named during the
          peak of Java's popularity, but the two languages share little beyond
          syntactic similarities. Java code is compiled into bytecode and
          executed by the JVM, while JavaScript is interpreted by web browsers.
          Understanding these differences is crucial when choosing the right
          language for your project.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="hello-world" class="main-section">
        <header>Hello World</header>
        <p>
          Creating a "Hello World" program is a traditional way to start
          learning a new programming language. In Java, this involves writing a
          simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Here's a
          basic example:
        </p>
        <code
          >public class HelloWorld { public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello, World!"); } }</code
        >
        <p>
          This program consists of a class named HelloWorld and a main method,
          which is the entry point for any Java application. The
          System.out.println statement outputs the text to the console. Save
          this code in a file named HelloWorld.java, compile it using javac
          HelloWorld.java, and run it with java HelloWorld.
        </p>

      <section id="variables" class="main-section">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>
          Variables in Java are used to store data that can be manipulated
          throughout the program. Each variable has a data type that defines the
          kind of data it can hold, such as integers, floating-point numbers,
          characters, and more. Java's strong typing system ensures that
          variables must be declared with a specific type before they can be
          used.
        </p>
        <p>
          Variables are fundamental in Java for storing values, performing
          calculations, and controlling the flow of the program. Proper variable
          naming and usage enhance code readability and maintainability, making
          it easier to understand and modify your code.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="declaring-variables" class="main-section">
        <header>Declaring Variables</header>
        <p>
          In Java, variables are declared by specifying the data type followed
          by the variable name. Here's an example:
        </p>
        <code> int age; double salary; char initial; </code>
        <p>Variables can also be initialized during declaration:</p>
        <code>
          int age = 25; double salary = 55000.75; char initial = 'J';
        </code>
        <p>
          Declaring variables correctly is crucial for efficient memory usage
          and avoiding runtime errors. Java's type system helps catch type
          mismatches at compile time, ensuring that variables are used
          consistently throughout the program.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="variable-scope" class="main-section">
        <header>Variable Scope</header>
        <p>
          Variable scope refers to the region of the program where a variable is
          accessible. In Java, scopes are defined by curly braces {}. There are
          three main types of variable scopes: local, instance, and class
          (static). Local variables are declared within methods or blocks and
          are accessible only within that context.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instance variables, declared within a class but outside any method,
          are accessible to all methods of the class. Class variables, declared
          with the static keyword, are shared among all instances of the class.
          Understanding scope is vital for managing variable lifetimes and
          preventing unintended interactions.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="global-variables" class="main-section">
        <header>Global Variables</header>
        <p>
          Java does not support true global variables as it adheres to
          object-oriented principles. However, class variables (declared with
          the static keyword) can serve a similar purpose by being accessible
          throughout the application. These variables are associated with the
          class itself rather than any specific instance.
        </p>

        <code>
          public class Example { public static int globalVar = 10; }
        </code>

        <p>
          In the above example, globalVar can be accessed using
          Example.globalVar from anywhere in the program. Using such variables
          sparingly and judiciously helps avoid potential conflicts and maintain
          code clarity.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="constants" class="main-section">
        <header>Constants</header>
        <p>
          Constants are variables whose values cannot be changed once assigned.
          In Java, constants are declared using the final keyword. It's common
          practice to name constants in all uppercase letters with underscores
          separating words.
        </p>
        <code> public static final int MAX_USERS = 100; </code>
        <p>
          Constants improve code readability and maintainability by providing
          meaningful names for fixed values used throughout the program. They
          also prevent accidental modifications, ensuring the integrity of
          values that should remain unchanged.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="data-types" class="main-section">
        <header>Data Types</header>
        <p>
          Java provides a rich set of data types to handle different kinds of
          data. These include primitive data types like int, double, char, and
          boolean, as well as reference data types like arrays, strings, and
          objects. Primitive types are predefined by the language and serve as
          the building blocks for data manipulation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reference types, on the other hand, are objects created from classes.
          Understanding and using these data types effectively allows for
          efficient memory management and optimal performance in Java
          applications.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="if...els-statement" class="main-section">
        <header>if...else Statement</header>
        <p>
          The if...else statement in Java is used for conditional execution of
          code blocks. It allows the program to make decisions and execute
          different code paths based on boolean expressions.
        </p>
        <code>
          if (condition) { // code to execute if condition is true } else { //
          code to execute if condition is false }
        </code>
        <p>
          Multiple conditions can be handled using else if. Properly utilizing
          if...else statements is essential for controlling the flow of a Java
          program and implementing logic that reacts to different conditions.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="while-statement" class="main-section">
        <header>while Statement</header>
        <p>
          The while statement in Java is a control flow statement that allows
          code to be executed repeatedly based on a given boolean condition. The
          loop continues as long as the condition remains true.
        </p>
        <code
          >while (condition) { // code to execute while condition is true }
        </code>
        <p>
          The condition is evaluated before each iteration, making while loops
          ideal for scenarios where the number of iterations is not known
          beforehand. Careful use of while statements helps in writing loops
          that effectively manage repetitive tasks.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="function-declarations" class="main-section">
        <header>Function Declarations</header>
        <p>
          In Java, functions are defined within classes and are known as
          methods. A method declaration specifies the method's return type,
          name, and parameters. Here's an example:
        </p>
        <code> public int add(int a, int b) {return a + b; } </code>

        <p>
          This method add takes two integers as parameters and returns their
          sum. Methods in Java enhance code modularity and reusability, allowing
          you to break down complex tasks into manageable, reusable code blocks.
